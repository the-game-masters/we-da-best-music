# We-da-best-music
* A repository designated to the implementation of personal assistant commands Phoebe Buffay would have used. 
## Group Members: Adriana Graybill, Aileen Murphy, Austin Wood, Brad Smialek, Jonny Graybill

### Conflict plan

* Try to get conflicting parties to self remediate, if that fails then bring in a third member of the group to mediate, if nothing else flip a coin for a resolution. If there is full on chaos we will delete the repo and then beg the instructor for mercy.

* If you are pissed you should play a game/walk away.

* Anyone can tell anyone else to take five.

* Remember first and foremost we are all on the same team and we should maintain that good will and shared vision.

* No one is here trying to break stuff, we are all here working towards the same goal.

* To address members who may not be contributing we will in a non-accusatory manor inform that member that more work is expected of them and then encourage and support them in order to make that happen.

### Communication plan

* Cell phones / slack -text to check slack but most information should be passed through slack after hours communication is okay but there is no expectation of checking slack or phones outside of specified hours. 6:30 - 9:30 pm working hours (regular class hours) Safe environment - reference conflict plan Everyone will talk everyday
### ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.

Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?

Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

Tasks
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team. During that meeting the group should review the Team Agreement guidelines and decide on a course of action for items such as communication and conflict resolution. Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn't be a problem. It's important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

Submitting Your Work
This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit

Review the team agreement, and as a group decide on which areas each group member should be aware of and which areas are strengths. Put a plan of action together for mitigating any communication issues amongst the team. Submit this agreement in the text field in Canvas.
