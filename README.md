# We-da-best-music
* A repository designated to the implementation of personal assistant commands Phoebe Buffay would have used. 
## Group Members: Adriana Graybill, Aileen Murphy, Austin Wood, Brad Smialek, Jonny Graybill

### Conflict plan

* Try to get conflicting parties to self remediate, if that fails then bring in a third member of the group to mediate, if nothing else flip a coin for a resolution. If there is full on chaos we will delete the repo and then beg the instructor for mercy.

* If you are pissed you should play a game/walk away.

* Anyone can tell anyone else to take five.

* Remember first and foremost we are all on the same team and we should maintain that good will and shared vision.

* No one is here trying to break stuff, we are all here working towards the same goal.

* To address members who may not be contributing we will in a non-accusatory manor inform that member that more work is expected of them and then encourage and support them in order to make that happen.

### Communication plan

* Cell phones / slack -text to check slack but most information should be passed through slack after hours communication is okay but there is no expectation of checking slack or phones outside of specified hours. 6:30 - 9:30 pm working hours (regular class hours) Safe environment - reference conflict plan Everyone will talk everyday

### Work plan: 
* Stand ups at the start of each day to lay out our work plan for the day and divy up assignments.
* Utilize github Kanban board to display and keep track of all tasks to do, assigned, and completed. 
* Keep communication channels open and civil so that all members can feel free to voice their ideas and complaints. 
* Require pull another group member to merge in pull requests.
* Merge into dev and use it as our production branch, keeping master in tact.
